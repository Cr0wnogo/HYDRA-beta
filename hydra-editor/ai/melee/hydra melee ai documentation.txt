Beta builds - https://github.com/Pr0nogo/HYDRA-beta

Setup for UMS maps:
-Make sure your AI has the correct race set in map settings
-Set crashed battlecruiser deaths for personalities and stasis chamber deaths for build orders
-To enable debug messages for showing AI personalities and build orders, set temple deaths above 0
-Run <race> expansion custom level in a location placed over the starting town hall
-To check if a player slot is running the melee AI, check for at least 1 khaydarin crystal death
-Results not guaranteed; the AI have only been tested with melee starting conditions
