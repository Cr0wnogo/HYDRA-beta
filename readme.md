# Project: Hydra, Melee Maps by Veeq7

This repository contains all melee maps I have made for Project: HYDRA.

# What is Project: HYDRA

>Project: HYDRA is a complete overhaul of Starcraft. When it is complete, the first three campaigns will have been remade, with accessory voice acting, significant changes to the techtrees, fully-fledged custom AI, and 2-player cooperative and melee support.

Project: Hydra is currently in development faze. It is daily developed by Pr0nogo and his cawtributors.
