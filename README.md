# Primer:

Project: HYDRA is a complete overhaul of Starcraft. When it is complete, the first three campaigns will have been remade, with accessory voice acting, significant changes to the techtrees, fully-fledged custom AI, and 2-player cooperative and melee support.

Due to its scope, this project is only compatible with Starcraft version 1.16.1. A detailed walkthrough for multiplayer setup is detailed in the link below, and a tool may be developed to circumvent the multiplayer limitations of pre-remastered SCBW closer to HYDRA's full release.

# Setup:
If you do not have version 1.16.1 installed, [follow this guide](http://pr0nogo.wikidot.com/sc-play).
You should also consult the above guide if you encounter any issues with windowed mode, running mods, etc.

Place HYDRA's maps in your maps folder, creating a specific directory for them if you wish.

HYDRA's custom exe and/or the classic installer from FaRTy1billion may alert your antivirus. Starcraft mods use code injectors to launch the game normally before applying the mod's changes, which will always seem suspicious to antivirus software. This mod and FaRTy's installer are both safe for your PC, but feel free to reach out if you have any concerns.

If you run into any other issues or have any other questions after following the guide linked above, message me.

# Multiplayer:
Community games are organized using Radmin VPN, a free and seemingly lightweight network utility.

* Download [Radmin VPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/)
* Join the No Frauds Club network with the following credentials:
  * __Network name:__ FRAUDSCLUB
  * __Password:__ toddad69
* Create and join Starcraft games by launching Starcraft, selecting Multiplayer, and selecting Local Area Network (UDP)
* Join the [No Frauds Club discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/s5SKBmY) to organize community games in real time

If your Radmin VPN is stuck on "waiting for adapter response", it is likely that the software's driver did not install correctly or was somehow corrupted. The only known fix for this is to reinstall the program.

# Issue Reports:
I often ship debug builds, which will print a simple message on map start indicating as such. Please be sure to delete your aise.log after each runtime to prevent it from becoming too large.

If a panic or freeze occurs during your playthroughs, open aise.log in a text editor (such as notepad++), copy the last 50 or so lines, and send them to me via pastebin or a separate text file.

If a crash occurs during your playthroughs, find your .err file in Starcraft\Errors and send it to me.

For more information and instructions on filing issue reports, please see the last question in the [HYDRA FAQ](http://pr0nogo.wikidot.com/sc-hydra#toc1).
